## What is Prow?

Prow is a Kubernetes-based CI/CD system.

## How can I use it?

<!-- TODO (listx): insert TestGrid dashboard link -->
If you've contributed to [Kubernetes][k8s], chances are you've already used it.
If you've ever used a TestGrid dashboard, you've definitely used it.

<!-- TODO (listx): Add examples here

## Where should I go next?

* [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/): Get started with $project
* [Examples](/docs/examples/): Check out some example code!
