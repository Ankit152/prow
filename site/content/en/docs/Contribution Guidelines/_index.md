  How to contribute to the docs
---

We use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to format and generate our website, the
[Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) theme for styling and site structure, 
and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to manage the deployment of the site. 
Hugo is an open-source static site generator that provides us with templates, 
content organisation in a standard directory structure, and a website generation 
engine. You write the pages in Markdown (or HTML if you want), and Hugo wraps them up into a website.
